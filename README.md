# Olist Business Analysis Project

### Overview
---
This project analyzes the Brazilian Olist e-commerce dataset to solve real-world business problems using SQL and Python.

The goal is to demonstrate how data can be used to drive business decisions across customer retention, operations, and marketing.


### Business Problems Addressed
---
### 1. Customer Retention & Loyalty (RFM Analysis)
**Business Question:**  
“We want to improve customer retention through a loyalty program, but we don’t know which customers are most valuable or at risk of churn.”

**Outcome:**
- Identified high-value, loyal, and at-risk customers
- Enabled targeted loyalty and retention strategies

### 2. Delivery Performance & Brand Reputation
**Business Question:**  
“We suspect delayed deliveries hurt our brand reputation. We need to quantify how delivery delays affect review scores.”

**Outcome:**
- Quantified how delivery delays affect customer review scores
- Found severe delivery delays cause ~57% drop in ratings

### 3. Product Category Revenue & Storage Efficiency
**Business Question:**  
“We have limited storage capacity. Which product categories generate the highest revenue, and which consume resources without proportional returns?”

**Outcome:**
- Ranked product categories by total revenue contribution
- Identified high-revenue categories that should be prioritized for storage
- Highlighted low-revenue categories that consume storage with limited returns

### 4. Seller Acquisition & Conversion Funnel
**Business Question:**  
“We invest heavily in lead generation, but we lack visibility into our conversion funnel — how many leads actually convert into revenue-generating sellers?”

**Outcome:**
- Built a seller funnel from marketing leads to active sellers
- Found only ~4.7% of marketing leads convert into revenue-generating sellers
